 - :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
 - :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
 - :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
 - :blush: Be nice, civil and polite.
 - :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will
   probably come faster.
